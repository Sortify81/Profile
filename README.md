üìù Sortify
Team ID: CC25-CF320


Despite the increasing awareness of environmental issues, many people still find it difficult to correctly sort their waste due to limited knowledge or accessibility. Our platform was designed to simplify this process and promote sustainable habits through the help of technology.

By making waste classification more accessible and engaging, we aim to:

Increase public awareness about proper waste management

Empower individuals to participate in recycling efforts

Promote the adoption of AI-driven solutions for sustainability

This project covers the full development lifecycle, including data collection, model training, full-stack development, and deployment, making it a comprehensive solution to a pressing real-world problem.
